### CHANGELOG
AllPowerShell Edition - v1.0.0 - 2018.01.16 
I've perfomed a major rewrite of the TriggerBitlocker script. For starters, I've moved from MSI to PS1 for installing the PS1, VBS and XML file. This is great because:
- More maintainable:  No need for MSI packaging (I honestly don't know how to do it)
- Easier to clean up: MSIs through Intune Mobile Apps must be Assigned->"Required", which means BitLockerTrigger will still be there even if it's done doing it's job

Other flaws I have looked at
- MSI remains/ reinstalls even if task is done (required in Azure Mobile Apps). Therefore I use a powershell-script to install the files.
	- PS1, VBS and XML files are stored as base64 encoded strings inside the Install-BitLockerTrigger.ps1
- Use of Aliases. It's now 100% Alias free.
- Created a new Recovery Password every run, no test to see if there already were password(s). 
	- My original device had 27 (!) BitLocker Recovery Passwords!
	- Will delete all but one, if more than 1 BitLocker Recovery Password exist
- ‎Files and scheduled task remained even if done
	- Better logic and cleaning, will remove files and scheduled tasks if everything finish successfully
- ‎Schedule now runs every 15 minute (edited the XML)
	- Thanks to Niklas Jern and Sebastian Thörnblad
- Did not check if backup already existed in OneDrive for Business and Azure AD
- Backup for OneDrive and Azure were handled in one big try-block. 
	- They are logically two different operations, and should be treated as such.
- No logic to catch x fail attempts
	- Add stats / history to programfile(x86)\BitLockerTrigger\stats.txt
		- With this you can add action(s) when counter reaches X
			- Like Email (coming)

TODO
- Email if failed stats reaches times
- Wrong OneDrive path!
