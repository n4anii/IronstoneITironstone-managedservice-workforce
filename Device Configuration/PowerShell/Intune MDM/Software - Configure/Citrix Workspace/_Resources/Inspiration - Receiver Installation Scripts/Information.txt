Introduction
Enclosed are six deployment scripts for Citrix Receiver deployments via AD broken into two groups:
Deployment Scripts:
1.	CheckAndDeployReceiverAdminStartupScript.bat
2.	CheckAndDeployReceiverWebPerMachineStartupScript.bat
3.	CheckAndDeployReceiverWebPerUserLogonScript.bat
Removal Scripts:
1.	CheckAndRemoveReceiverAdminStartupScript.bat
2.	CheckAndRemoveReceiverWebPerMachineStartupScript.bat
3.	CheckAndRemoveReceiverWebPerUserLogonScript.bat

Modify Scripts
The scripts are modified in the header section of each file.  Here are the parameters that can be set:
1.	Current Version of package – example set DesiredVersion= 13.0.0 – This Plugin version number is validated and if it is not present, then the deployment proceeds.
2.	Package Location/Deployment directory – This points to a network share where the Plugin packages are located.  This network share is not authenticated by the script, so the shared folder must contain the EVERYONE = READ security setting.
3.	Script Logging Directory – This points to a network share where the Install Logs are copied.  This network share is not authenticated by the script, so the shared folder must contain the EVERYONE = READ, WRITE security setting.
4.	Package Installer Command Line Options – These command line options are passed to the installer and typically include the XenApp server name, among other settings.
Create OU
To begin the deployment using AD, one must first create an OU.  The administrator should create one OU for each script that is executed.  For example, go to your server, Open Active Directory Users and Computers, select the Domain Name and right-click and select the Domain Name node and select “New Organizational Unit”.  Create a Deploy OU and a Remove OU.  Enter the name(s) for your new OU(s) and close the window.
Create a GPO
Right click on the newly created OU(s), and then select “Enforced”.

Right-click on the newly created OU(s) and then select Edit.  Notice that there are two main headers in the left-hand pane described as both Computer Configuration and User Configuration.
