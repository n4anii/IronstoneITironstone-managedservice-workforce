TODO
	Both
		* Make it more generic, so that everything thats needed is 3-4 variables
	Install-IronSync(Customer_Application).ps1
		Switch for (1) Initial config vs (2) update existing config
			1. Delete all conflicting shit
				* If templates are in use, schedule script to run on next reboot
			2. Don't touch the templates folder, AzCopy will handle that

	
	
	
CHANGELOG

		* Will not delete previous folder, AzCopy will simply overwrite the content.
		* All customer variables is only written in top of the install-script, gets "slipstreamed" into the Run-IronSync(Application_Customer).ps1
