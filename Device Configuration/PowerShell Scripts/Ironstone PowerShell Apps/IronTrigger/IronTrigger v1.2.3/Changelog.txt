### TODO / FUNCTIONALITY WE WANT TO ADD
	Both
		- Use PowerShell Transcript for logging, remove custom functions
			- Append
		- Use PowerShell Output Strams for logging and debug, remove custom functions
	Install-IronTrigger.ps1
		- Implement Ironstone Device_Verb-Noun template
		- Create Scheduled Task with pure powershell; no more XML
	Enable-BitLocker.ps1
		- Simplify
		- Add more dynamic handling of multiple internal partitions
		- OneDrive for Business:
			- Better error-handling than just "Make sure you are AAD joined". For instance:
				- When AAD Joined, but OD4B not done configured
				- (?) Auto configure OD4B
		- Backup other encrypted, fixed drives
			- Don't force encryption on those, only backup if they exist
		- Webhook, email or similar for notifying admins about X failed runs 


### RESOURCES
* Base64Encode.org (https://www.base64encode.org/) for Base64 encoding of the files

v1.0.0 - 2018.01.16 - "AllPowerShell Edition"
I've perfomed a major rewrite of the TriggerBitlocker script. For starters, I've moved from MSI to PS1 for installing the PS1, VBS and XML file. This is great because:
- More maintainable:  No need for MSI packaging (I honestly don't know how to do it)
- Easier to clean up: MSIs through Intune Mobile Apps must be Assigned->"Required", which means BitLockerTrigger will still be there even if it's done doing it's job

Other flaws I have looked at
- MSI remains/ reinstalls even if task is done (required in Azure Mobile Apps). Therefore I use a powershell-script to install the files.
	- PS1, VBS and XML files are stored as base64 encoded strings inside the Install-BitLockerTrigger.ps1
- Use of Aliases. It's now 100% Alias free.
- Created a new Recovery Password every run, no test to see if there already were password(s). 
	- My original device had 27 (!) BitLocker Recovery Passwords!
	- Will delete all but one, if more than 1 BitLocker Recovery Password exist
- ‎Files and scheduled task remained even if done
	- Better logic and cleaning, will remove files and scheduled tasks if everything finish successfully
- ‎Schedule now runs every 15 minute (edited the XML)
	- Thanks to Niklas Jern and Sebastian Thörnblad
- Did not check if backup already existed in OneDrive for Business and Azure AD
- Backup for OneDrive and Azure were handled in one big try-block. 
	- They are logically two different operations, and should be treated as such.
- No logic to catch x fail attempts
	- Add stats / history to programfile(x86)\BitLockerTrigger\stats.txt
		- With this you can add action(s) when counter reaches X
			- Like Email (coming)
