This is a sample of a Cisco AnyConnect VPN Client Profile XML file.
This file is intended to be maintained by a Secure Gateway administrator
and then distributed with the client software. The xml file based on
this schema can be distributed to clients at any time. The distribution
mechanisms supported are as a bundled file with the software distribution
or as part of the automatic download mechanism. The automatic download
mechanism only available with certain Cisco Secure Gateway products.
NOTE: Administrators are strongly encouraged to validate XML profile they
create using an online validation tool or via the profile import
functionality in ASDM. Validation can be accomplished with the
AnyConnectProfile.xsd found in this directory.
