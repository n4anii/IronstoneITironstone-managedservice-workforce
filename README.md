# Ironstone Workforce development
This is Ironstones internal codebase for Workforce. As an Ironstone consultant you are free to use any code and documentation published in this repo.

Remember to follow the basic rules!

## Rules
1. All resources published in this repo is Ironstone property and some of it might be IP`s, do not share **anything** with customers and/or competiters without approval, or if the readme files explicit allows it.

2. Do not put customer sensitive information in this repo. If your team needs a private github repo to share customer sensitive information, create a new github repo seperate from this one.

3. The goal of our github workflow is to ensure that all content in the master branch always is release ready.

4. Remember that commit messages are important, especially since Git tracks your changes and then displays them as commits once they're pushed to the server. By writing clear commit messages, you can make it easier for other people to follow along and provide feedback.

5. Do not leave you branch "hanging". As soon as development/changes are done and testet send in your pull request!

## How to use
The master branch is protected from directly push, and all changes should be done with a branch-pull request workflow like this:

1. Create new branch with a logic naming ex. `exchangepsma-newfeature`
2. Develope your code and do commits to your new branch.
3. Send in a pull request
4. One of the people with given access will merge your pull request into master asap and delete the branch.
