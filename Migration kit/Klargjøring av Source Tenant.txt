		Click Grant admin consent.
		Click Yes to confirm the settings.
		In MigrationWiz, select the project that needs to be configured for Modern Authentication.
		Click the Edit Project menu.
		Select Advanced Options.
		Under Support Options enter the ClientID and TenantID information you saved earlier in the following format:
		If enabling Modern Authentication for the Source:

		ModernAuthTenantIdExport=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
